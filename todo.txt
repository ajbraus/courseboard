  - user narratives, template design
    - A student comes in the first day and sees that they have all 0's for competency. They want to get some initial competency. They approach an instructor and ask to be levelled up. They show proof that they have advanced iOS knowledge and want to be set at a level of "approaching competency (3)". The instructor agrees. 

    "Certification Option"
    The instructor goes to the instructor dashboard and click's "Update Student Mastery". 
    They autocomplete the student's name and then add the competency tag and the level. 
    They can do multiple at once and provide one reason or project with URL that proves that competency. 
    Then they log those competencies. 
    The competencies are then visible on the student's profile, when they were logged, for what reason and by whom.
      - a certification has one instructor and one student, many competencies, and each competency has a level
      var certification = {
        createdAt: '',
        updatedAt: '',
        student: '_id',
        instructor: '_id',
        note: '',
        competencies [
          { name: 'iOS', level: 3 }
          { name: 'Flask', level: 1 }
          { name: 'Python', level: 2 }
        ]
      }
      var certification2
      iOS => 4
      var user = {
        ...
        competencies: [
          { name: 'iOS', level: 3 }
          { name: 'Flask', level: 1 }
          { name: 'Python', level: 2 }
        ]
      }
      certification.competencies 
      => [competencies]
      var user = User.findById(_id).populate('certifications')
      user.competencies
      => [competencies]

      _.map(user.certifications, function(certs) {
        _.flatten(certs)
      })

    "Mastery Table Option"
    The instructor goes to the instructor dashboard and click's "Update Student Mastery".
    They look up the student and the entire table of competency levels appears
    They look over the student's competencies and the rubrics and make all the necessary updates
    They give a reason for competencies, and save.
    Admins can create a new competency from the admin dashboard
    Embed the competency in the user
      var user = {
        competencies [
          { updatedAt: "", name: "iOS", level: 3, instructor: "_id", note: "blah blah" }
        ]
      }
