  - user narratives, template design
    - A student comes in the first day and sees that they have all 0's for competence. They want to get some initial competence. They approach an instructor and ask to be levelled up. They show proof that they have advanced iOS knowledge and want to be set at a level of "approaching competence (3)". The instructor agrees. 

    "Certification Option"
    The instructor goes to the instructor dashboard and click's "Update Student Mastery". 
    They autocomplete the student's name and then add the competence tag and the level. 
    They can do multiple at once and provide one reason or project with URL that proves that competence. 
    Then they log those competences. 
    The competences are then visible on the student's profile, when they were logged, for what reason and by whom.
      - a certification has one instructor and one student, many competences, and each competence has a level
      var certification = {
        createdAt: '',
        updatedAt: '',
        student: '_id',
        instructor: '_id',
        note: '',
        competences [
          { name: 'iOS', level: 3 }
          { name: 'Flask', level: 1 }
          { name: 'Python', level: 2 }
        ]
      }
      var certification2
      iOS => 4
      var user = {
        ...
        competences: [
          { name: 'iOS', level: 3 }
          { name: 'Flask', level: 1 }
          { name: 'Python', level: 2 }
        ]
      }
      certification.competences 
      => [competences]
      var user = User.findById(_id).populate('certifications')
      user.competences
      => [competences]

      _.map(user.certifications, function(certs) {
        _.flatten(certs)
      })

    "Mastery Table Option"
    The instructor goes to the instructor dashboard and click's "Update Student Mastery".
    They look up the student and the entire table of competence levels appears
    They look over the student's competences and the rubrics and make all the necessary updates
    They give a reason for competences, and save.
    Admins can create a new competency from the admin dashboard
    Embed the competency in the user
      var user = {
        competences [
          { updatedAt: "", name: "iOS", level: 3, instructor: "_id", note: "blah blah" }
        ]
      }
