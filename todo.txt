make flagging remove comment (are you sure?)

teach users to use the app more
  - what is it for
  - how to vote
  - features, sort by vote_count, etc

track when users join or leave rooms and the # of users
  on $locationChangeStart - emit leaving.room, '/:room_name' - if listener is in room, decrement
  on $locationChangeSuccess - emit joining.room, '/:room_name' - if listener is in room, incrememnt
  upon arriving in a room . . . how many people are there?
    create Room model and track userCount there

    $scope.$on('$locationChangeStart', function(event, next, current) {
      if(current_user.is_logged_in){
        var route_object = ($route.routes[$location.path()]).route_object; //This is how you get it
        if(!(route_object.route_roles)){
            event.preventDefault();
        }
      }
    });

    $scope.userCount = 0;
    // USER ENTERS THE ROOM
    $scope.$on('socket:broadcast.user_connected', function (event, data) {
      console.log(data);
      if (data == $scope.room.name) {
        $scope.userCount = ++$scope.userCount;
      }
    });

    // USER LEAVES THE ROOM
    $scope.$on('socket:broadcast.user_disconnected', function (event, data) {
      console.log(data);
      if (data.room_name == $scope.room.name) {

      }
    });



track how many cookies your questions get per session
  track ids of questions client asks
  when they are voted up, give you a cookie, voted down, take a cookie away

vote up/down flashes the question

deploy to AWS

  http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/create_deploy_nodejs_console.html

Make Ionic app gobble up that JSON and have socket.io

scale:
  on broadcast, only publish if room_name === room_name - not scalable! and every client is recieving every question across the whole system . . .

add grunt package.json and include grunt files in git

unify cookie and add maxAge of 7200000
  upgrade angular to 1.4.x
  if (!$cookies.questionCookie) {
    var questionCookie = {
      vup_ids: [],
      vdp_ids: [] 
    }
    $cookies.putObject('questionCookie', $scope.questionCookie, {'expires': 7200000});
  } else {
    $scope.questionCookie = JSON.parse($cookies.questionCookie)
  }

  console.log(JSON.parse($cookies.questionCookie))
